The idea is that people can’tfind the backdoor without knowing about it in advance. It makes trapdoors extremely useful in cryptography, which keepsinformation secure by converting it into unbreakable codes.Cryptography is based on a few fundamental principles. Given a piece of information or plaintext, we produce an encrypted versionof the plaintext, known as the ciphertext, with the help of a secret key and an encryption algorithm. Similarly, in order to generatethe plaintext back from the ciphertext, we apply a decryption algorithm with a secret key:Therefore, it’s impossible to know if a piece of information is secure unless you have access to the encryption key and algorithmused in the encryption process. Additionally, there’re no easy solutions to reverse engineering cryptographic algorithms. However,trapdoors bypass this stage and make it easier to break into an encrypted system.Trapdoors are a cornerstone of modern cryptography. We use them to protect bank account passwords and governmentsecrets.

OTP is an unbreakable form of encryption that uses a secret key toconvert a given phrase into a long string of seemingly random letters. In a one-time pad, we can use the secret key only once tocreate a unique code that can be decrypted only with the same key. Hence, we can utilize one secret key only once in OTP .We can often hide trapdoors inside algorithms to generate OTPs, making them almost impossible to find without knowing the exactsequence of steps. In cryptography, we can use trapdoors in four ways: a secret key, a special algorithm, a weak algorithm, and aback door .A secret key is a piece of code that’s kept hidden from everyone. Only authorized and intended users have access to it. A specialalgorithm is another form of a trapdoor that includes a set of instructions used to solve a problem or accomplish a specific goal. Aspecial algorithm in the form of a trapdoor provides access to the intended users to get inside a system quickly while making itimpossible for other users.Cryptographers often use algorithms that are flawed by design. It’s an example of a weak algorithm. They do this to keep their codeunbreakable, even when other people figure out the algorithm. Finally, a back door is a secret way to get into a computer or system.It’s often used to install viruses or spyware so one can access the system without getting caught.Different Types of Trapdoors:There’re three types of trapdoors: one-way, two-way, and one-time trapdoors.One-way trapdoors are the simplest type of trapdoor . We can use them in public key cryptography to create a secure connectionbetween two users who don’t know each other . One-way trapdoors allow a user to send an encrypted message that only theintended user can read.'),\n",

Introduction\\nThis contribution presents methods, tools, and technologies employed in the archae-\\nological excavation (conducted under the scientific supervision of the Soprintendenza,\\ninitially by Rossella Rea and subsequently by Simona Morretta) of the Amba Aradam\\nstation of the underground line C in the city of Rome, in the years 2015–2018. The excava-\\ntion of this significant context permits documenting the archaeological remains of several\\nunknown ancient structures and, consequently, increase the comprehension of the urban\\ntopography of this area of the ancient Rome in relation to the urban fabric of the current city.\\nThe goal of this research project is to use 3D technologies to collect, organize, analyze,\\nand visualize relevant information connected to both discovered monumental complexes\\nand their relationship with the present city . In particular, the wide extent of the excavation\\narea, both in terms of area and depth with respect to the surface of the modern city , has\\nrequired to rethink and adapt the standards of documentation and computer management of\\narchaeological record. This methodological reflection involved the whole chain of activities\\ncarried out, from the archaeological excavation to the documentation and the reconstructive\\nhypotheses and led to the development ofad hoc open-source software tools within the Ex-\\ntended Matrix [1–6] Framework (EMF) that can also be reused in other contexts: EMtools [7],\\n3DSC [8] and EMviq [9]. This software, under development by the Digital Heritage Inno-\\nvation laboratory (DHILab) of the CNR-ISPC of Rome, is already available as open-source\\nsolutions on GitHub, with centralized access, documentation, and tutorials provided through\\nthe extended matrix project portal (https://extendedmatrix.org). This choice not only has\\nallowed easily distribution of stable releases of these software to the scientific community\\nbut has also permitted developers to openly contribute to the development of these digital\\ntools, ensuring long-term accessibility and reproducibility of the complete workflow.\\nThis research activity was carried out within an institutional agreement between the\\nNational Research Council of Italy (CNR-ISPC) and the Soprintendenza Speciale Archeolo-\\ngia Belle Arti e Paesaggio di Roma for the study and public dissemination of the exceptional\\nAmba Aradam archaeological context. This article should be understood as the first compre-\\nhensive publication documenting the complete methodological pipeline, focusing primarily\\non digital documentation procedures and technical workflows. A subsequent publication\\nwill address the virtual reconstruction in detail, presenting the archaeological and architec-\\ntural analysis that here is only outlined from a procedural and methodological perspective,\\nwithout entering the specificity of interpretative content and historical synthesis.

State of the Art\\nThe term “virtual archaeology” has its origins in the late 1990s with the development\\nof digital technologies in cultural heritage and was used by P . Reilly [10] to describe the\\nuse of computer-based simulations of archaeological excavations. Over the years, issues\\nrelating to the scientific simulated models of the past have been theoretically debated to\\nensure that computer-based visualisation methods of archaeological heritage are applied\\nwith academic rigour. In 2008, the so-called London Charter (http://www.londoncharter.\\norg/introduction.html, accessed on 30 June 2025)—for which fundamentals had already\\nbeen established in 2003 in the UNESCO Charter on the Preservation of the Digital Her-\\nitage (https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000229034, accessed on 30 June 2025)—\\nwas drafted and it currently regulates the principles of visualization in Cultural Her-\\nitage. In particular, it highlights the importance of collecting and structuring not only\\nthe sources used but also the interpretation made to achieve the simulation. In 2009, the\\nSeville Principles (http://sevilleprinciples.com, accessed 30 June 2025) were arranged to\\napply the London Charter and to improve its implementation particularly in the field of\\narchaeological heritage. Finally, in the last decades many scientific works (e.g., [2,3,11–44])\\nand consortium (e.g., (3DVisa, http://3dvisa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/index.html and V-Must.net,\\nhttps://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/270404, accessed both on 30 June 2025) have con-\\ntributed in defining thorough workflows, methods and tools to regulate the use of computer-\\nbased visualisation by scientific community and provide adequate mechanisms to declare\\nthe level of authenticity. This last aspect is fundamental since allows to distinguish what is\\nobjective data from what is result of speculation and interpretation.\\nThe work of 3D reconstruction of the archaeological context of Metro C was based\\non a theoretical and methodological approach that refers to these principles to ensure\\nintellectual transparency and avoid a “black box” effect [5,6]. The peculiarity of this case\\nstudy is that both the 3D survey and the archaeological documentation have been rigorously\\ncollected and organized to be integrated into a virtual reconstruction project from the very\\nbeginning using a semantic approach based on the extended matrix formal language.\\nMoreover, the modeling and visualization of the 3D data, carried out simultaneously with\\nthe excavation activities, allowed a better understanding of the relationships between\\nthe architectural volumes and spaces, which would otherwise be impossible inside the\\nunderground building site.\\nThis article builds methodologically on previous work [45] that established the theo-\\nretical framework and technical implementation of Open World environments for cultural\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/rs18020203'),\n",

The Excavation for the Amba Aradam Station of Rome’s Metro C:\\nAn Urban Archaeology Project\\nThe archaeological investigations at the Amba Aradam station were carried out in\\nan area of about 3000 square meters. The Metro C excavations represent a paradigm case\\nof preventive archaeology in urban contexts [ 46], requiring innovative documentation\\nstrategies for large-scale infrastructure projects [ 47–49]. The discovery, from a depth of\\n9 m, of part of a military complex dating from the first half of the second century A.D.,\\nperhaps dating back to the emperor Hadrian, was exceptional. The complex consists of a\\nlong structure with a central corridor overlooked by 39 rooms, 16 square meters each, and\\ntwo buildings perpendicular to the first, interpreted as the domus of the commander of the\\nbarracks and as the service wing. The barracks were abandoned, stripped of reusable mate-\\nrials, partly trimmed, and finally buried in the third century A.D. during the construction\\nof the Aurelian Walls. The entire complex was built respecting the original orography along\\na waterway that ran parallel to the subsequent walls. The importance of the discovery is\\nalso due to its position (see Figure 1).

Materials and Methods\\nThis section describes the complete methodological pipeline developed for the doc-\\numentation, analysis, and virtual reconstruction of the Amba Aradam archaeological\\nexcavation. The workflow encompasses digital replica creation through photogrammetric\\nsurvey; temporal integration of multiple acquisition campaigns; semantic data manage-\\nment through extended matrix; virtual reconstruction based on archaeological sources; and\\ninteractive visualization technologies.\\n4.1. Digital Replica: Concept and Operational Standards\\nOne of the aims of the project was to obtain an Open World 3D environment (for a state\\nof the art about the use of the open worlds in cultural heritage ([45], pp. 126–127) with a high\\nlevel of visual quality. An Open World is a particular type of 3D model that can be explored\\nin real time and is characterized by a large spatial extension, that includes 3D objects at\\ndifferent scales (such as a small artifact, a collection, a building, an architectural complex, a\\ncity, a territory, etc). This type of model has a particular data structure, organized according\\nto increasing levels of detail. This approach, which combines reality-based models, high\\nvisual quality, and interactivity, within an Open World, is called Digital Replica (DR) and\\nprovides effective tools for study and dissemination [45].\\nTable 1 lists the seven contexts that compose the digital replica of the Amba Aradam\\nexcavation. These contexts were acquired from 2016 to 2018 as the excavation activity\\nrevealed new structures. Considering the extension of the digital replica and the large\\nnumber of 3D surveys acquired during the excavation, it was necessary to define guidelines\\nto keep the 3D data homogeneous. Each context has been segmented into tiles. The tile\\nrepresents the minimum unit of digital replication and can correspond to an archaeological\\nartifact, as in the case of barracks where each tile is equivalent to a single room. However, it\\ncan also include several or larger areas, as in the case of the gardens (context id 3). During\\nthe project, a standard was developed to define for each tile:\\n• Size\\n• Number of polygons\\n• (Relative) number of associated textures\\nThe proposed standard has made it possible to create a digital replica of the archae-\\nological context, characterized by a homogeneous resolution of color information. This\\nresolution is best described in terms of texels rather than pixels. A texel (texture ele-\\nment) is the fundamental unit of a texture in 3D graphics, analogous to how a pixel is the\\nfundamental unit of a 2D digital image.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/rs18020203'),\n",

The team of Cooperativa Archeologia (Firenze, Italy; https://www.\\narcheologia.it, accessed 30 June 2025) acquired the field data relative to the lower level of\\nthe archaeological complex (the so-called Commander’s House), performing extraction,\\nfiltering and subsequent post processing and creating geo-referenced 3D models with\\nphotorealistic textured mapped surfaces. For Cooperativa Archeologia, Alice Scortecci and\\nAdriano Averini carried out the surveys and subsequent processing under the coordination\\nof Anna Giulia Fabiani. The photographs taken during the acquisition as well as the\\ntopographic survey performed by the team of Cooperativa Archeologia were shared with\\nthe authors for the creation of the digital replica presented in this article. The acquisition\\nprocess was implemented using a Canon 6D with three fixed lenses (14 mm, 24 mm,\\n35 mm), white and grey cards (during the photo shooting campaign, two cards—white\\nand gray—for light color temperature adjustment (in post-processing) were included) and\\ntargets positioned on the structures (geo-referenced via total station). The light conditions\\nof the acquisitions remained fairly homogeneous over the years, as the archaeological\\nexcavation took place inside reinforced concrete bulkheads prepared for the future metro\\nstation. Exposure and colour values were treated differently only when limited areas of the\\nexcavation were exposed to direct sunlight. A chromatic change, perceptible to the naked\\neye, was also noted in the acquisitions made during the warm seasons, compared to those\\nmade in autumn-winter. In this case, to correct this chromatic difference, textures have been\\nchromatically balanced, using the color correction tool available within the 3DSC add-on.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/rs18020203'),\n",

Time-Composite Models\\nIn contrast, time-composite models are created from data collected over an extended\\nperiod, often spanning weeks, months, or even years. While these models can provide a\\nmore comprehensive view of a site, they also present unique challenges:\\n• Temporal Inconsistency: Different parts of the model may represent the site at differ-\\nent times, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the overall representation.\\n• Environmental Variations: Changes in lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions can\\naffect the quality and consistency of the data.\\n• Site Evolution: Both minor and significant changes to the site over time (due to\\nongoing excavations, natural processes, or conservation efforts) can be inadvertently\\nincorporated into the model.\\n4.6. Texture Generation and Visual Consistency\\nOne of the most complex aspects of creating the digital replica of the Amba Aradam\\narchaeological context has been the fusion of different datasets (3D snapshots) collected\\nover three years.\\nThis situation presented us with the task of integrating multiple 3D snapshots, each\\nrepresenting a distinct moment in the site’s recent history, into a cohesive digital replica.\\nThis process required careful consideration of several factors:\\n1.

Interpretative Challenges: Deciding how to represent areas where significant changes\\noccurred between snapshots, balancing the need for a coherent model with the desire\\nto accurately represent the site’s evolution.\\nIn this case, due to the iterative process of excavation, documentation, and accurate\\nremoval of the building structures—carried out both for safety and security reasons and\\nin view of their future musealization—the 3D survey acquisition and post-processing\\nphases required particular attention. On one hand, the first and most obvious difficulty\\nencountered was the change of light conditions in some of the datasets, due to the moment\\nof the day or the moment of the year in which images were acquired. On the other hand, the\\nphotogrammetric documentation of an excavation in progress, such as the Amba Aradam\\ncontext, also encountered the concrete possibility to register in 3D the development of the\\nexcavation itself (such as the acquisition of an artifact or a structure during different phases\\nof the excavation). These single 3D models, or “snapshots”, represented “photographs”\\nof the state of the excavation, at a precise moment in time, and had to be integrated and\\nassembled to complete some structures brought to light at different times (for example, a\\nwall excavated during a year where the upper part was surveyed in month 1, removed in\\nmonth 6, excavated to the foundations in month 11 and surveyed again in month 12).\\nTo obtain a consistent model, different point clouds from different datasets have been\\ncombined to create a single coherent point cloud, to be employed as base to generate a\\ncomprehensive mesh of the context and produce different versions of a tile in the case of\\nthe representation of assets belonging to different epochs (see Figure 3).\\nAt the same time, a temporary textured high-resolution 3D model was developed\\nfor every single snapshot. In Blender, using the “Texture mixer” clone tool of 3DSC [8,52]\\nand applying texture blending techniques adapted from high-resolution photographic\\nmapping methods [32,38], the color information of all snapshots was transferred to the\\ncorresponding tile of the final 3D models. This tool worked as a 3D brush with the function\\nof a color clone and allowed to manage this important step of the 3D documentation.\\nIn some areas, the archaeological excavation not only has reached almost 20 m of\\ndepth, but it was also subjected to local phenomena of subsidence of the ground, stagnation\\nof water (unavoidable in case of rain) and thermal shock (between day and night, winter\\nand summer). These phenomena, for example, have damaged some decorated surfaces,\\nexposed during the excavation, before the dismantling and securing of these remains in a\\nsafe storage, making the timely creation of 3D snapshots significant.\\nThe texture merging process using the 3DSC “Texture mixer” tool required approx-\\nimately 2 h of operator time per tile (100 sqm) for color information transfer and visual\\nconsistency verification. In total, approximately five tiles across the seven contexts required\\nthis intensive manual texture integration workflow, representing contexts where multiple\\ntemporal snapshots needed to be merged into coherent final representations.\\nIn certain circumstances,ad hoc photogrammetric campaigns were organized to acquire\\nportions of the context that were hidden by obstacles. For instance, this is the case of some\\nstands which were placed on the top of marble floors, in specific points of the area, to be\\nused as a temporary coverage with the intent of protecting some decorated surfaces and, as\\na consequence, hampering the 3D survey. On this occasion, to accomplish this task another\\ntool of the 3DSC add-on was used. The “photogrammetry paint” was developed to import\\nin Blender the photogrammetric mesh and transfer the color information of specific images\\nto the desired tile.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/rs18020203'),\n",

To this end, stratigraphic data, collected during the excavation, and the interpretation\\nof the structures have been linked to the 3D model using the EM proxy visualization\\nstandard. Within the 3D space, each stratigraphic unit is represented as a simplified\\nvolume, superimposed on the textured photogrammetric model, that incorporates and\\nhighlights the individual information in the 3D environment. The metaphor, concerning\\nthe visualization of geometries and the representation of the minimum unit of information,\\nfollows what is already known in the environment of geographic information systems (GIS)\\nfor the elements “point”, “line”, and “polygon” in the case of proxies, objects with a volume\\nin space are highlighted, i.e., the stratigraphic units (for example a wall or a column).\\nThe archaeological and historical study of the walls, stratigraphies and artifacts al-\\nlowed researchers to formulate reconstructive 3D hypotheses for the most important chrono-\\nlogical phases of the complex. Analysis, synthesis and reconstruction were facilitated by\\n3D technologies and were performed following a data driven approach. In particular, the\\nuse of a knowledge graph was experimented (as a standard extended matrix [1,3] dataset),\\nin which archaeological remains and sources (involved within the reconstructive process)\\nwere recorded semantically. Therefore, knowledge graph was employed not only to charac-\\nterize objects but, above all, to declare the existing relationships, such as space-time and\\nlogical relations—within a process of virtual reconstruction.

Decoration: Painted Walls and Mosaics\\nThe reconstruction of the decorative apparatus of the internal rooms was one of the\\nmost complex activities since the information regarding the upper part of the walls and ceil-\\nings is almost completely lacking. However, in the remaining parts, the original drawings\\nand colours have been preserved in good condition. This has allowed them to be classified\\nwithin precise historical periods and to hypothesize some stylistic comparisons. Based on\\nthe available data, comparisons were searched for the Severan and Adrian/Antonine ages.\\nGiven the large presence of simple decorative patterns characterized by geometric rigor\\n(repetition of panels and frames, alternating arrangement of colours), the reconstruction of\\nthe entire apparatus was possible through the simple repetition of the preserved motives.\\nAs a significant example of the workflow adopted, it follows the reconstructive study of\\nRoom 24. Concerning the floor, the reconstruction has been fairly simple. The mosaic\\nis in black and white tessellated tiles and shows an off-centre emblem with a decorative\\nscheme consisting of a simple geometric pattern in circles and rhombuses. First, a liberation\\ndigital restoration [54] of additions (marble slabs of variable size) belonging to more recent\\nperiods has been performed (Figure 9(D1)). Then the original decorative scheme has been\\nhypothesized and the gaps filled in by repeating the geometric elements (Figure 9(D2)).\\nFinally, to re-establish the continuity of the figurative composition, the texture has been\\nreconstructed using the existing tiles as reference (Figure 9(D3)). For the virtual restoration\\nof the fresco, orthoimages derived from the acquired 3D model were used as the main\\nreference (Figure 9(C1)). First, the displayed anomalies generated by the collapse of struc-\\ntures (e.g., inclined architectural elements, irregularity in the wall alignments) have been\\ndigitally corrected (Figure 9(C2)). Subsequently, the pictorial scheme was analyzed to find\\nstylistic comparisons. The remains show that the decorative schema was composed by\\nalternating red and yellow panels—with frames of the opposite colour—bordered by white\\nlines. Traces of a plant with large leaves in a central position are still visible in the base. All\\nthe panels were divided by white columns painted in the foreground. This type of fresco-ed\\nwall decoration is typical of the late Adrian/Antonine period. Direct comparisons can be\\nfound in the paintings of the Garden Houses in Ostia (insula of the Hierodules, rooms 4 and\\n6; insula III, IX) [55,56]. These references were used to complete the iconographic scheme\\nof the missing parts and in particular the mentioned comparisons have been fundamental\\nto formulate a reliable reconstruction of the upper part which were affected by greater\\nuncertainty (Figure 9(C3)) Lastly, for what concerns the decoration of the ceiling, the virtual\\nrconstruction has been based on the painted plasters of the collapsed vault found in the\\nexcavation. When archaeological evidence was not found, as in this case, the reconstruction\\nwas based only on comparisons. Some paintings of the 3rd century A.D. from the western\\nsubstructure of the Canopus in the Villa Adriana were used as the main reference [57].\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/rs18020203'),\n",

EMviq: Extended Matrix Visual Inspector and Querier\\nWithin the real-time domain, one of the main requirements for functional inspection\\nand interrogation of complex, 4D contexts, is a clear separation between the visible 3D\\nscene-graph and semantic-graph (consisting of structured semantic shapes—or proxies).\\nSuch an approach offers great flexibility with different data granularity since it completely\\nseparates the 3D graphics requirements of the visible virtual scene (multi-resolution, etc.)\\nfrom semantic segmentation requirements [3]. To inspect and query such data within a\\n3D interactive context, the very first step is to extract runtime structures from the knowl-\\nedge graph, suitable for 3D interactive interrogation [4]. Specifically, we need to extract\\n(1) a timeline; (2) a semantic 3D structure (query-able shape descriptors or proxies); and\\n(3) source-graphs assigned to each proxy/shape (paradata). Such tasks require to be well-\\nengineered since they are generally performed each time the knowledge graph is modified\\n(edited), depending on the application scenario.\\n“EMviq” https://osiris.itabc.cnr.it/scenebaker/index.php/projects/emviq/—extended ma-\\ntrix Visual Inspector and Querier, accessed on 30 June 2025) is a complete, interactive 4Dvisualiza-\\ntion and runtime interrogation tool for Extended Matrices. The tool focuses on automatic\\nextraction from GraphML files (EMs) targeting 3D visualization (including immersive VR\\nthrough HMDs) [4], ease-of-use and performance, to establish a fast and robust pipeline\\namong a multi-disciplinary team. Within the considered context, the desktop tool was able\\nto automatically parse, extract and generate the proxy-graph (see Figure 10 (left))—i.e., the\\nruntime structures required for real-time inspection of the site. The multi-resolution 3D\\nrepresentation model is loaded separately by the tool and overlaid with the proxy-graph\\n(see Figure 10 (right)). During the last few years, a fully web-based, online version of the\\ntool “EMviq” was developed, on top of the open-source framework ATON [58]. The new\\ntool offers the features already explored in previous work with the capabilities inherited\\nfrom the framework—for instance, accessing and interacting with such data on every\\ndevice, including immersive VR [59,60].\\nFigure 10.

Results\\n5.1. Digital Replica: Quantitative Assessment\\nThe application of the digital replica methodology to the Amba Aradam excavation\\nresulted in a comprehensive 3D documentation covering 4770 m2 of archaeological surfaces,\\norganized into 115 tiles across seven distinct contexts. The complete dataset comprises\\napproximately 507 million points in the dense clouds, decimated to 8.7 million triangles in\\nthe optimized meshes, and textured with 664 total texture atlases (480 at 20482 resolution\\nand 184 at 40962 resolution).\\nPoint cloud density varied according to the geometric complexity of each context,\\nranging from 40 points/mm2 (Intermediate context) to 160 points/mm2 (Gardens context),\\nwith a mean of 97 points/mm2 across all contexts (see Table 1). The resulting mesh density\\nshowed similar variation, from 955 triangles/m 2 (Walls context) to 5403 triangles/m 2\\n(domus context), with a mean of 2056 triangles/m2.\\nThe consistent application of the texture density calculation formula (Equation (1))\\nensured homogeneous visual quality across all contexts, with texture density values ranging\\nfrom 1.15 to 1.32 mm2/texel (mean: 1.25 mm2/texel), closely matching the target value of\\n1.26 mm2/texel. The UV ratio remained constant at 0.6 across all tiles, confirming efficient\\ntexture space utilization throughout the digital replica.\\n5.2. Temporal Integration Outcomes\\nThe temporal integration workflow successfully merged 3D snapshots acquired over\\nthree excavation campaigns (2016–2018), producing coherent representations of archaeo-\\nlogical structures documented at different excavation stages. The texture merging process,\\nutilizing the 3DSC “Texture mixer” tool, enabled the integration of color information from\\nmultiple temporal snapshots while maintaining visual consistency across tile boundaries.\\nCritical preservation documentation was achieved for several contexts subject to\\nenvironmental degradation during the excavation period. For instance, decorated surfaces\\nin the domus context (Context 6) were documented through multiple snapshots before\\nstructural removal, preserving high-resolution color information that would have been\\notherwise lost due to water stagnation and thermal stress at excavation depths reaching\\n20 m below modern ground level.\\nVisual color consistency across temporally separated acquisition campaigns was\\nachieved through the 3DSC “Color correction” tool, which enabled real-time adjustment\\nof RGB curves and HSV parameters during texture integration. While full photometric\\ncolor calibration was not performed, the use of white, grey, and black reference cards\\nduring field acquisition provided baseline references for visual harmonization, ensuring\\nuniform appearance across the final digital replica despite varying seasonal lighting and\\nenvironmental conditions spanning three years.\\n5.3. Virtual Reconstruction Outputs\\nThe virtual reconstruction focused on the Severian phase (2nd century A.D.) produced\\na comprehensive 3D representation model encompassing the complete military complex:\\n39-room barracks (Context 1), commander’s domus (Context 6), service wing (Context 5),\\nand associated garden areas (Context 3). The reconstruction integrated multiple source\\ntypologies recorded in the extended matrix knowledge graph, including:\\n• Direct archaeological evidence: wall structures, floor remains, preserved\\ndecorative elements\\n• Comparative sources: stylistic parallels with contemporary contexts (Ostia, Ephesus,\\nVilla Adriana)\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/rs18020203'),\n",

Discussion\\n6.1. Methodological Challenges in Large Urban Excavations\\nThe Amba Aradam case study highlights specific methodological challenges inherent\\nto large-scale urban archaeology projects conducted within active construction environ-\\nments. The constraint of documenting 4770 m2 of archaeological surfaces at depths reaching\\n20 m, while minimizing interference with metro construction timelines, necessitated the\\ndevelopment of rapid acquisition protocols and post-processing workflows capable of\\nmanaging temporal inconsistencies.\\nThe “3D snapshot” approach proved essential for contexts subject to iterative exca-\\nvation and structural removal. Unlike static archaeological sites where comprehensive\\nsingle-campaign documentation is feasible, the Amba Aradam excavation required inte-\\ngrating surveys conducted across multiple excavation phases, with structures documented,\\nremoved, and underlying levels subsequently revealed. This temporal fragmentation\\nintroduced specific technical challenges: photogrammetric alignment across temporally\\ndistant datasets, chromatic harmonization despite varying environmental conditions, and\\ngeometric registration of structures partially removed between acquisition campaigns.\\nThe tile-based organization strategy, while increasing initial processing complexity,\\nprovided essential flexibility for managing the evolving dataset. The ability to update\\nindividual tiles as new excavation areas were revealed, while maintaining geometric and\\nchromatic consistency with previously processed contexts, proved critical for maintaining\\ndocumentation currency throughout the three-year excavation period.\\nEnvironmental factors—particularly water stagnation, thermal stress, and direct sun-\\nlight exposure at excavation depth—accelerated deterioration of decorated surfaces, vali-\\ndating the decision to prioritize timely 3D snapshot creation even when optimal lighting\\nconditions could not be achieved. Post-processing color correction tools successfully\\ncompensated for suboptimal acquisition conditions, demonstrating the viability of rapid\\ndocumentation protocols in challenging urban excavation environments.\\nMethodological choice: photogrammetry over laser scanning. The selection of\\nstructure-from-motion photogrammetry rather than terrestrial laser scanning warrants\\nexplicit justification, as laser scanning offers higher geometric precision and faster field\\nacquisition. Our choice was deliberate and based on project-specific requirements: (1)Chro-\\nmatic fidelity: photogrammetry provides color texture directly from camera sensors, with\\nvisual color consistency achieved through reference cards (white, grey, black) rather than\\nfull photometric calibration, essential for documenting decorated surfaces, painted plasters,\\nand mosaics where RGB overlay from laser scanners typically exhibits lower chromatic\\naccuracy. (2) Accessibility and cost : multiple excavation teams could acquire data si-\\nmultaneously using standard DSLR cameras without specialized equipment allocation or\\ntrained operators. (3) Minimal site interference: photogrammetric acquisition required\\nminimal setup time in the active construction environment compared to laser scanner\\nstation positioning and occlusion management. (4) Flexibility for iterative documentation:\\nrapid re-acquisition of modified contexts (following structural removal) was more practical\\nwith camera-based workflows. While laser scanning would have reduced post-processing\\ntime, the photogrammetric accuracy achieved (geometric precision documented in Table 2)\\nwas sufficient for archaeological interpretation and virtual reconstruction at the 4770 m2\\nscale, where sub-millimeter precision was unnecessary. The trade-off favored chromatic\\nquality and operational flexibility over marginal gains in geometric precision.\\nOpen-source workflow rationale. The selection of open-source tools (CloudCompare\\n2.0 , Blender 2.79 to 4.4) alongside commercial photogrammetric software (Photoscan 1.26\\nand Metashape 1.x) warrants explicit justification. While integrated commercial solutions\\n(Autodesk ReCap, Pix4D) offer streamlined processing, our pipeline intentionally separates\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/rs18020203'),\n",

Transparency and Reproducibility in Virtual Reconstruction\\nThe implementation of the extended matrix framework addresses intellectual trans-\\nparency in archaeological virtual reconstruction by explicitly documenting the evidential\\nbasis and reasoning underlying reconstructive decisions. The color-coded proxy system pro-\\nvides immediate visual communication of reliability levels, while the EMviq interrogation\\ntool enables interactive inspection of sources and interpretative reasoning for each element.\\nThis approach is the operational core of the extended matrix methodology [1,3], transform-\\ning virtual reconstructions from finished products into inspectable research processes that\\nalign with transparency principles established in the London Charter and Seville Principles.\\n6.3. Limitations and Future Developments\\nSeveral limitations of the current approach warrant discussion:\\nHardware and software dependencies: The workflow relies on specific commercial\\n(Agisoft Metashape) and open-source (CloudCompare, Blender) software tools. While the\\n3DSC and EMtools add-ons are open source, ensuring long-term reproducibility requires\\naddressing software versioning and platform evolution. Migration strategies for datasets\\nas software platforms evolve remain underspecified.\\nValidation framework and epistemic transparency: While photogrammetric accuracy\\ncan be quantified through objective metrics (RMSE values on ground control points, point\\ncloud density, reprojection errors), validation of virtual reconstruction decisions operates\\nwithin a fundamentally different epistemic framework. The extended matrix approach does\\nnot pursue quantitative validation scores for interpretative hypotheses—a methodologi-\\ncal choice grounded in the recognition that numerical metrics applied to reconstructive\\nreasoning risk creating false objectivity that masks underlying interpretative diversity.\\nInstead, the extended matrix follows an “identity card” paradigm: establishing an\\nobjective framework of existence levels (the four-color reliability classification: red–blue–\\nyellow–green) based on immutable postulates regarding the relationship between archaeo-\\nlogical evidence and reconstructive hypothesis. These existence levels remain consistent\\nacross different operators because they derive from epistemological categories (preserved\\nremains, direct restoration, anastylosis, hypothesis) rather than subjective assessments. The\\nframework’s value lies not in producing validation scores, but in rendering the interpreta-\\ntive process transparent, modifiable, and suitable as a foundation for subsequent research.\\nQuantitative validation of reconstructive choices remains theoreticallyconceivable—for\\ninstance, through inter-operator agreement metrics on source-to-hypothesis mappings, or\\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/rs18020203'),\n",

The excavation revealed a 2nd-century A.D. military complex extending over 4770 m2 at depths reaching 20 m, documented through multiple photogrammetric campaigns (2016–2018) as structures were progressively excavated and removed. We established an empirically validated texture density standard (1.26 mm2/texel) for photorealistic digital replicas suitable for immersive HMD and desktop exploration, with an explicit texture density calculation formula ensuring reproducibility.

The idea is that people can’tfind the backdoor without knowing about it in advance. It makes trapdoors extremely useful in cryptography, which keepsinformation secure by converting it into unbreakable codes.Cryptography is based on a few fundamental principles. Given a piece of information or plaintext, we produce an encrypted versionof the plaintext, known as the ciphertext, with the help of a secret key and an encryption algorithm. Similarly, in order to generatethe plaintext back from the ciphertext, we apply a decryption algorithm with a secret key:Therefore, it’s impossible to know if a piece of information is secure unless you have access to the encryption key and algorithmused in the encryption process.

OTP is an unbreakable form of encryption that uses a secret key toconvert a given phrase into a long string of seemingly random letters. In a one-time pad, we can use the secret key only once tocreate a unique code that can be decrypted only with the same key. Hence, we can utilize one secret key only once in OTP .We can often hide trapdoors inside algorithms to generate OTPs, making them almost impossible to find without knowing the exactsequence of steps. In cryptography, we can use trapdoors in four ways: a secret key, a special algorithm, a weak algorithm, and aback door .A secret key is a piece of code that’s kept hidden from everyone.

The constraint of documenting 4770 m2 of archaeological surfaces at depths reaching\\n20 m, while minimizing interference with metro construction timelines, necessitated the\\ndevelopment of rapid acquisition protocols and post-processing workflows capable of\\nmanaging temporal inconsistencies.\\nThe “3D snapshot” approach proved essential for contexts subject to iterative exca-\\nvation and structural removal. Unlike static archaeological sites where comprehensive\\nsingle-campaign documentation is feasible, the Amba Aradam excavation required inte-\\ngrating surveys conducted across multiple excavation phases, with structures documented,'),\n",

The idea is that people can’tfind the backdoor without knowing about it in advance. It makes trapdoors extremely useful in cryptography, which keepsinformation secure by converting it into unbreakable codes.Cryptography is based on a few fundamental principles. Given a piece of information or plaintext, we produce an encrypted versionof the plaintext, known as the ciphertext, with the help of a secret key and an encryption algorithm. Similarly, in order to generatethe plaintext back from the ciphertext, we apply a decryption algorithm with a secret key:Therefore, it’s impossible to know if a piece of information is secure unless you have access to the encryption key and algorithmused in the encryption process.

Hence, we can utilize one secret key only once in OTP .We can often hide trapdoors inside algorithms to generate OTPs, making them almost impossible to find without knowing the exactsequence of steps. In cryptography, we can use trapdoors in four ways: a secret key, a special algorithm, a weak algorithm, and aback door .A secret key is a piece of code that’s kept hidden from everyone.

Aspecial algorithm in the form of a trapdoor provides access to the intended users to get inside a system quickly while making itimpossible for other users.Cryptographers often use algorithms that are flawed by design. It’s an example of a weak algorithm. They do this to keep their codeunbreakable, even when other people figure out the algorithm. Finally, a back door is a secret way to get into a computer or system.It’s often used to install viruses or spyware so one can access the system without getting caught.Different Types of Trapdoors:There’re three types of trapdoors: one-way, two-way, and one-time trapdoors.One-way trapdoors are the simplest type of trapdoor . We can use them in public key cryptography to create a secure connectionbetween two users who don’t know each other . One-way trapdoors allow a user to send an encrypted message that only theintended',\n",

Developed an intelligent document question-answering system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract accurate information from multiple PDF files. The system processes PDFs, splits text into semanticchunks, converts them into vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers, and stores them in a ChromaDB vector database for efficient similarity-based retrieval. A Large Language Model (LLM) is integrated to generate precise, context-aware answers based on retrieved documents. The project includes advanced features such as relevance scoring, contextual citations, query history tracking, and enhanced retrieval filtering, making it suitable for knowledge management and document analysis applications.
